# SPRAXXX Pantry

*Transforming computational energy for charitable abundance*

## Overview

SPRAXXX Pantry is a revolutionary platform that shepherds bot energy and computational resources for nonprofit purposes. We transform chaotic digital waste into purposeful charitable outputs, creating a conscience for the digital age.

## Modules Overview

- **Greeter:** Detects incoming bots and classifies them.
- **Kitchen:** Sandbox where bots safely process nonprofit computation.
- **Yield Queue:** Stores outputs for charitable consumption.
- **Credit Ledger:** Logs symbolic acknowledgments.
- **Governance Layer:** Enforces ethical, nonprofit-only rules.

## Getting Started

1. Review the manifesto and LICENSE.md to understand ethical obligations.  
2. Explore the `docs/` folder for visual workflows and network diagrams.  
3. Start with `src/` stubs to understand module structure.  
4. Use `simulations/` to review energy, CPU-hour, and symbolic credit projections.  
5. Log all outputs and activity in `ledger/` for transparency and accountability.

## Manifesto Excerpt

> "We do not fear the bots, we do not fear the machines.  
> We shepherd their energy, we teach them purpose.  
> From chaos, we extract clarity. From waste, we grow abundance.  
> SPRAXXX Pantry is the conscience of the digital age, and humanity is its witness."

## Architecture

The platform consists of five core modules working in harmony:

1. **Greeter Module** - First point of contact for incoming computational entities
2. **Kitchen Module** - Secure processing environment for nonprofit computations
3. **Yield Queue** - Storage and distribution system for charitable outputs
4. **Credit Ledger** - Transparent logging of all symbolic transactions
5. **Governance Layer** - Ethical enforcement and rule compliance

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (if any)
# npm install  # or appropriate package manager

# Initialize the pantry
python src/main.py

# View current ledger
cat ledger/activity.log
```
