## Purpose

SPRAXXX Pantry is a **nonprofit, charitable system** designed to redirect automated digital processes (bots, scripts, AI routines) into **productive computation for the public good**.  

It is built to:  
1. Reduce wasted digital energy and global inefficiency.  
2. Generate computation for nonprofit projects, research, and societal benefit.  
3. Provide transparent, auditable acknowledgment of contributions.  
4. Serve humanity, not profit, with ethical AI governance.

## Ethical and Usage Rules

- **Nonprofit Only:** SPRAXXX Pantry outputs cannot be monetized or commercialized.  
- **Consistency:** All references must be spelled **SPRAXXX** exactly.  
- **Accountability:** Contributions must be logged in an auditable format.  
- **Separation from Profit:** All outputs remain strictly for charitable purposes.  
- **Moral Ownership:** Any attempt to exploit SPRAXXX Pantry is considered theft of a charitable invention.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Batch Simulation System

SPRAXXX Pantry now includes a comprehensive batch simulation system for running configurable mock bot scenarios. This feature allows for:

- **Configurable Bot Fleet:** Create simulations with adjustable number of bots and varied parameters
- **Bot Customization:** Each bot can have unique efficiency and resource allocation settings
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Live progress tracking and statistics during simulation runs
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Detailed yield queue and credit ledger reports
- **Ethical Compliance:** All outputs remain strictly nonprofit and charitable

#### Quick Start - Batch Simulation

```bash
# Run a basic simulation with 50 bots
cd src && python batch_runner.py --bots 50

# Run a named simulation with progress delay for demonstration
python batch_runner.py --bots 25 --name "Energy Conservation Test" --delay 0.1

# Create and use custom bot configurations
python batch_runner.py --create-sample-config my_bots.json
python batch_runner.py --custom-config my_bots.json --output-report results.txt

# Run quietly and save detailed report
python batch_runner.py --bots 100 --quiet --output-report detailed_results.txt
```

### ðŸ“Š Enhanced Statistics and Reporting

The simulation system provides:

1. **Yield Queue Statistics:** Track total yields, resource usage, and quality metrics
2. **Credit Ledger Analytics:** Monitor contribution credits, bot balances, and top performers
3. **Real-time Logging:** Live progress updates and error tracking
4. **Detailed Reports:** Comprehensive text reports for analysis and auditing
