## 1. Quantified Environmental Impact of Bot Traffic

### Global Energy Consumption Data

| Source | Annual Consumption | Environmental Impact |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| ChatGPT | ~10 TWh | 0.3 Wh per response × 9B daily searches |
| Bing (GPT-4) | 7.2 TWh | 7,200 MWh annually |
| Google Bard | 0.312 TWh | 312 MWh annually |
| General Bot Traffic | >10 TWh | >40% of total internet traffic |
| **Total AI Bots** | **~27.5 TWh** | **Equivalent to small country consumption** |

### Comparative Analysis

- **1.5 Million Cars:** 85.4 TWh annually
- **1.5 Million Servers (full capacity):** 85.4 TWh annually  
- **Bot Traffic (estimated):** 10+ TWh annually
- **SPRAXXX Pantry Potential Savings:** Significant reduction through efficient redirection
