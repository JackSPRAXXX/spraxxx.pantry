# SPRAXXX Pantry â€“ Simulation Overview

**Purpose:** Document planned simulations for energy, processing, and yield.

### Simulations Planned

1. **Energy Savings Projections**
   - Estimate reduction in wasted electricity by redirecting bots.

2. **CPU-Hour Utilization**
   - Track the computational load handled by redirected processes.

3. **Nonprofit Yield Estimates**
   - Quantify outputs generated for charitable projects.

4. **Symbolic Credit Distribution**
   - Model how contributions are logged in the Credit Ledger.

### Notes

- Tables, charts, or diagrams can be added as simulations are run.  
- Simulations are strictly for **auditing and improvement**, not monetization.
