## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Environmental Impact Quantification

| Source | Annual Consumption | Equivalent Impact |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| ChatGPT | 10 TWh | 0.3 Wh × 9B daily searches |
| Bing (GPT-4) | 7.2 TWh | 7,200 MWh annually |
| Google Bard | 0.312 TWh | 312 MWh annually |
| **General Bot Traffic** | **>10 TWh** | **>40% of internet traffic** |
| **Total Bot Impact** | **~27+ TWh** | **Equivalent to small country** |

**For Context:**
- 1.5 million cars consume 85.4 TWh annually
- 1.5 million servers at full capacity consume 85.4 TWh annually
- Bot traffic represents a significant portion of this digital energy consumption

### 1.2 Current Regulatory Gap

- **No oversight** of bot traffic energy efficiency
- **No reporting requirements** for automated process energy consumption
- **Limited incentives** for efficient digital resource utilization
- **Missed opportunity** for beneficial computation redirection

## 2. Legal Authority: Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) 1999

### 2.1 Statutory Foundation

**CEPA Purpose:** "To contribute to sustainable development through pollution prevention and the protection of the environment and human health."

### 2.2 Applicable Provisions

#### Pollution Prevention (Section 56-58)
- **Authority:** Mandate pollution prevention plans for significant environmental impacts
- **Application:** Bot traffic energy waste constitutes digital pollution
- **Solution:** Require efficiency plans for large-scale automated processes

#### Control of Substances (Part 5)
- **Authority:** Regulate activities that may harm environment or health  
- **Application:** Energy waste indirectly contributes to environmental pollutants
- **Solution:** Classify wasteful bot traffic as regulated digital activity

#### Environmental Data Collection (Part 3)
- **Authority:** Mandate collection and reporting of environmental data
- **Application:** Bot traffic energy consumption lacks proper monitoring
- **Solution:** Require energy consumption reporting for automated systems
