## Environmental Impact Simulations

### 5. Global Bot Traffic Energy Analysis
- **Baseline Data:**
  - ChatGPT: ~10 TWh annually (0.3 Wh per response)
  - Bing with GPT-4: 7.2 TWh annually
  - Google Bard: 0.312 TWh annually
  - General bot traffic: >40% of internet traffic

### 6. Comparative Energy Consumption
| Activity | Annual Consumption (TWh) | Environmental Impact |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Bot Traffic (estimated) | ~10 | High waste potential |
| SPRAXXX Pantry (productive) | Variable | High efficiency |
| 1.5M Cars | 85.4 | Very High |
| 1.5M Servers (full capacity) | 85.4 | Very High |

### 7. Canadian Legal Framework Impact
- **CEPA Compliance:** Pollution prevention through efficient computation
- **Public Interest:** Quantifiable environmental benefits
- **Policy Potential:** Regulatory framework for digital energy efficiency

## Simulation Results (Live Data)

*Results are generated during each execution of main.py*

### Sample Output Metrics:
